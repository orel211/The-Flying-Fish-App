# The-Flying-Fish-App

In the game you can see a character of a fish that you can make jump by tapping on the screen.
By this you can make the fish collect different balls that come in its way:
Yellow ball - adds 10 points to your score,
Green ball - adds 50 points to your score,
Gray ball - reduces 50 points from your score (should be avoided),
Red ball - reduces one life point (should be avoided).
View the screenshot file for illustration.
You only have 3 life points (represented by 3 images of heart on the top right of the screen) so make sure you use them wisely
and collect as much points as you can. Good luck!
